## Population Management System
A simple Population management system that user can use to to insert and view populations of different location.

## API Documentation
The API has routes, each dedicated to a single task that uses HTTP response codes to indicate API status and errors. View full API documentation [here](https://#/)


## Technologies Used
- **[JavaScript ES6](http://es6-features.org/)** - Codes were written in javascript ES6.
- **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)** - Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
- **[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)** - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. I used this framework for routing.
- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** - Postgres is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance.
- **[Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/)** - Sequelize is a promise-based ORM for Node.js which supports the dialects of PostgreSQL and features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.

## Installation
- Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) on your machine

- Create a `.env` file in your root directory as described in `.env-example` file and replace the data with the database credentials you just created
- run migration `npm run migrate:test`
